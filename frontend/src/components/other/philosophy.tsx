      This studio is a reaction to the self-limiting, gate-keeping,
      perfectionist tendencies that keep all of us from doing the things we want
      to do.

      There is no overarching style or school or even type of art going on here,
      because the artist has not been trained in any of them.

    <p>Each department started here as a "how hard could it be" experiment.</p>
